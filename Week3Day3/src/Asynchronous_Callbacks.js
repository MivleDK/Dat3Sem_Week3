/* 
 * Person (function) is called with parameter Kurt Wonnegut at runtime which is why it displays right away.
 * We have not declared a new person and stored one in a var which is why "name" is not attached to anything on the next line
 * 
 * You should only capitalise the first character of the name of a function when you need to construct the object by "new" keyword.
 * This is called "the Constructor Invocation Pattern", a way to inherits.
